## Radiant Team Chat App
### Meteor 1.3 / React / ES6 Modules
##Why

I needed a project for working on the last version of meteor and react using the new version of javascript(ES6/ES2015). I have a lot of experience in javascript but I needed a project for working (and showing to my clients) that I can easily handle new technologies ! After a basic version I will work on a React-Native App.

##What is Radian

I want to do an easy and opensource advanced team chat. 

##Installation  

You need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) before installing the application

Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:GManzato/Radiant.git` in your project directory

After simply type `npm install` and after `meteor`
